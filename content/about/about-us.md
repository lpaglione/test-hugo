SeamlessAccess.org is a service designed to help foster a more streamlined online access experience when using scholarly collaboration tools, information resources, and shared research infrastructure. The service promotes digital authentication leveraging an existing single-sign-on infrastructure through one’s home institution, while maintaining an environment that protects personal data and privacy.

The SeamlessAccess Persistence Service is a mechanism that allows participating resource providers to save information about an end-user’s home institution into the end-user’s Web browser, but in a manner that permits other participating resource providers to read the information about the end-user’s home institution.  This can be used to facilitate convenient one-click redirection to the end-user’s institutional login page from any participating resource provider.  No personally identifiable information (e.g., user name, password, name, email, etc.) about the end user is stored - only a few pieces of information about the end-user’s home institution, such as the institution’s name and location of the institution’s login page.

The optional SeamlessAccess Discovery Service can be used by resource providers to facilitate a one-time search for the end-user’s home institution, and then store the information about the user’s institutional selection into the Persistence Service.  Many resource providers may have their own institution lookup process, and SeamlessAccess also provides a mechanism where participating resource providers can store the user’s selection into the Persistence Service.
